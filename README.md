# HeartDiseaseClassifier

This project uses a dataset provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease. 

There are several hundred rows in the CSV. Each row describes a patient, and each column describes an attribute. 

This information was used to creat a basic classifier to predict if a patient has heart disease.
